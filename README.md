# GameOn

This is a university project's final assignment of the course Systems Analysis and Development.
It's still under development so do not mess with the branches.

## Technology

We chose to use React Native and Expo as framework, our final project needs to run on mobiles both Android and IOS, and we came to the conclusion that Web is a great extra.

## About Execution

Run `npm install` to install dependecies if there is a need.
Run `npx expo start` to start server at localhost port 8081. Use the `-c` flag to clean the cache as starts.
If Expo Go isn't starting the project, try `npm i -g @expo/ngrok@latest` then `npx expo start -c --tunnel`.

## Branches

- main
